"I've been a fan of LeBron since day 1. I live in Southern IL close to STL and basketball isn't really popular around here. Maybe a few Bulls fans but that is it. I have always rooted for players more than teams (I loved Reggie Miller and Stockton-to-Malone). My nerves are absolutely destroyed already and I can't imagine how Cleveland residents/lifelong Cavs fans are feeling right now. I got to see LeBron win two titles in Miami including the epic Headband Game 6. The basketball gods have done me well. But basketball gods, please let Cleveland win this one. Not for me, not for LeBron....... but for the city of Cleveland. Golden State got theirs last year. Steph Curry and the rest of his team have already went down in history. If Golden State loses we will still remember them as being one of the best teams we have ever witnessed.

Does no one remember how bullshit the 2014 nba draft was? I hope this Cavs team loses, not because I hate Cleveland or Lebron or anything like that. The Cavs were handed a championship team on a silver platter. They should not be this good. Cleveland fans acting like they have it so hard when they've gotten 4 1st picks in 10 years. The warriors build up their team through smart drafting, player loyalty, team culture and innovation. The Cavs fucking should be in the finals, if a team can't become a contender with 4 1st picks under their belt they would have to be the most incompletely run sports franchise the world has ever seen.

"Some personal predictions:

If Barnes, Speights, and Iggy get 5 or more threes total then I am loving GSW chances

If Warriors are within 5 or leading at the start of the 4th, they will win

If Warriors go up by double digits at any time they will win

Bold: If Ezeli gets 2 blocks in the first quarter, GSW will win

If Klove hits 4+ threes and Kyrie and Lebron combine for 60+ then Cle will win

"Cavs win the finals. 

Varejao is sitting in his house when the doorbell rings. He opens the door to find a package that says ""from Cleveland"". His heart begins to beat in anticipation of whats inside. 

He tears off the tape and digs though the packing peanuts to find a beautiful velvet ring box. Thousands of emotions run through his brain as he slowly opens the case. 

Inside is a single note that says ""fuck you"". Underneath is a plastic toy ring with a mold of Varejao as he is falling to the floor like his been shot. 

After a few monents Varejao grimaces and clutches his chest. He collapses to the floor and stops moving. The paramedics are called. When they arrive they start taking his vitals. The head paramedic freezes and then says, ""i'm sorry to say this, but he is faking it"".

"Ya nose bleeds are seats way high up, and since the basketball court is pretty small compared to a soccer of football field, the view is not very pleasant. I'm a bit confused as to what you meant in the middle, but I think your asking about why dont we see many cavs fans in the arena. Well that's probably because first of all any ticket for a game 7 costs tons of money and since America is so large, Cleveland and Oakland(Where the warriors play) is probably about a 4 hour plane ride. So if you add the cost of the plane ticket, getting somewhere to stay in Oakland, and the price of the game ticket itself, its a whole lot money. Also because of that, fans don't really have a reason to go to oakland  if they weren't going to the game because there'd be nothing to do. The winning team usually has a victory parade in their city a few days after they win where they will be in floats and cars going down the main streets of their own city celebrating as as fans can watch. From what ESPN has shown, it looks like in Cleveland they are having a watch party inside the cavs stadium for cleveland fans to watch together.
