Okay so Draymond is not going to have another half like that. Kyrie and Klay haven't done much and are due for theirs. Cleveland can't buy a three and is only down 7. Lebron has been having a hard time balancing being agressive and getting his teammates involved like he seems to be doing that at the wrong times. Cleveland has also had some strange substitution patterns. I have a gut feeling the shooting will balance out a bit more with these two teams and we're looking at a finish right down to the wire with a role player making a huge clutch play. ,,,,drewbie32,[SAC] Mike Bibby,,1466385404,t5_2qo4s,t3_4ow6vj,t3_4ow6vj,-1,1469157355,0,0,d4g15c0,nba,-1,,Kings2

"So...my thoughts:

* If you are a Varejao hater, your hate was most certainly validated.
* If you are a Dray hater, this is probably your worst nightmare.
* Lebron is playing...ok so far (12 pt, 8 boards, 5 ast) but he also has 5 TOs and the rest of his team has started a brick laying foundation beyond the arc.
* Splash Brothers still playing like crap, Draymond (and the bizarre lack of defense on him) is the only reason they are even in this right now (see second point).
* The refs have been fairly decent so far. I counted...maybe 2 soft calls but nothing egregious.

Final View of 1st Half:

* It's closer than it looks. The Cavs were abysmal from 3 in the first half. You have to assume they'll progress to the mean. Warriors are shooting better than average, but not by so much that you expect a second half drop unless the Cavs adjust. 
* If the Warriors can stay patient, play better defense in the paint, and Curry or Klay stop playing like ass, then they'll probably win
* Conversely, if the Cavs wake up from their 3-pt slumber (or just abandon it), cool off the Warriors from distance, and Lebron and/or Kyrie get back to their Game 5 &amp; 6 form, the Cavs should be able to come back.",,,,Spartanfox,Lakers,,1466385651,t5_2qo4s,t3_4ow6vj,t3_4ow6vj,9,1469157437,0,0,d4g1bjd,nba,9,,Lakers1

The thing is the Cavs need LeBron and Kyrie like they did in Game 5. The issue right now is their offense is terrible right now. The Warriors are playing much better defense with switching and communicating. There haven't been a lot of LBJ v Curry scenarios either.

"Calm down Cavs fans. LeBron going 3/7 in the Finals doesn't make him the GOAT. Enjoy the title, but stop being ridiculous on Reddit.

edit: ""Any chance LeBron wins Finals MVP even if Cleveland loses? He's been the best player in this series, by far, up to this point."" That's my post from before the game. Clearly I think LeBron was the best player in the series, but I'm not ignorant enough to act like he's the best player ever all of a sudden after all his Finals appearances.

"I don't think it is a choke. I think they were doomed after the game 5 suspension Green and the loss of Bogut. Little things happened to them like the Cavs last year and I think that the Cavs were just better. Saying they choked out is like taking away credit from the Cavs. I'd be more inclined to say the Cavs took it. I think in today's NBA the finesse game the Warriors play in the regular season can get 73 wins but I honestly never thought the style would win in the playoffs because it gets so physical. If you remember even last year it was pretty atrocious by both teams due to the physicality. LeBron was lauded for great play and shot 35% for goodness sake. This year was much better and just realize, it took everything the Cavs had in addition to the Warriors deficiencies down to the last minute of game 7.

"While that's certainly true -- there are also a lot of other players that have the same impact even before LeBron, but somehow he's elevated beyond (maybe that's just a sign of great branding).

People forget AI in his prime, they forget they forget Shaq -- going back further, players like Rodman. I'm instantly supposed to believe that he's the the only freak of nature able to have that much of an impact?

The crux of my whole argument still stands. Look at the headlines:

""LEBRON BROUGHT US THIS TITLE"", which undermines the effort and work of his entire squad, particularly Kyrie. Beyond his skillset what he brought with him was money. That's based off the strength of his brand...which I suppose has successfully alienated the masses as they intended. That's the real feat.

I don't even like him all the time but it's hard not to try to give him credit when there are just as many people hating and trying to take away everything he does get credit for.  Like I said Kyrie is the reason they won, we saw last year he can't do it alone.  But the cavs don't win it and probably don't even get close without him.",,,,Jaxmax07,Cavaliers,,1466493512,t5_2qo4s,t3_4ow6vj,t1_d4hi6c5,2,1469186717,0,0,d4hq6k9,nba,2,,Cavaliers2
"Bro I would have been thrilled to see him as MVP.  He's my favorite player and I have three of his jerseys in my closet.  Love him, but if your taking talking points from first take and using it as you reasoning for real badketball conversation that's a problem.  I played one of year of D3 ball and worked my whole life to get there.  I just wasn't good enough and I played at a higher level than these dudes.  His is the same guy that gave the mavs no credit when the beat LBJ and mark Cuban destroyed him live on air with real basketball knowledge.  He didn't even know the mavs played a zone.",,,,Jaxmax07,Cavaliers,,1466493843,t5_2qo4s,t3_4ow6vj,t1_d4haful,1,1469186765,0,0,d4hqabc,nba,1,,Cavaliers2
"Haha skip really knows the game..... Is that all you got man? Objectively speaking, espically since Kyrie is my fav and Lebron and I have a love /hate.  I knew who was wining MVP last night..... Even without him leading every statistical category.  It's was close I'll give you that.  Neither guy wins without the other, but lebrons game spoke for him",,,,Jaxmax07,Cavaliers,,1466494030,t5_2qo4s,t3_4ow6vj,t1_d4ha094,1,1469186792,0,0,d4hqcdq,nba,1,,Cavaliers2
Also notice how the guy that actually played basketball is defending Lebron.  He took his whole game into account.  Not just the last shot.  I take nothing away from Irving but nothing can be taken away from Lebron either.,,,,Jaxmax07,Cavaliers,,1466494387,t5_2qo4s,t3_4ow6vj,t1_d4haful,1,1469186844,0,0,d4hqgcd,nba,1,,Cavaliers2

"You might be right man, there is a way to show and slow the player down just enough to let the guy you want to be gaurdong him to catch back up, and the cavs don't have a lot of shooters.  Curry and there backup bigs got killed when they switched everything.  Curry on Irving and Lebron was a nightmare this series.
