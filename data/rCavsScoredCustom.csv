2151,"We can come back. Draymond Green getting scorching hot is the only reason why they're ahead. We need to start hitting threes of our own though. We can't beat them like this.

LeBron can't keep turning it over. He has more turnovers today than the last 2 games combined. He needs to get composed and play like he did in the last 2 games. Not necessarily 41 points, but driving to the rim and looking to score, not pass. Get the inside game going first, then start taking jump shots.

Has Kyrie seemed a bit passive to anyone else? He's had his moments where he's aggressive and he's been successful for the most part. But it just seems like he isn't taking it to guys as much as he did the last few games. Anyone else get that sense?

Why has TT not played much? He is vital to us. Get Shump off the floor and give TT more minutes. 

I like what I saw from Love rebounding-wise, I hope he can get it going on offense.

Overall, I don't love our situation but it could be worse. Draymond is insanely hot and I'm banking on halftime to cool him off. We just need a stretch of a few mins where we get stop after stop after stop. And we need to convert on offense. This is a very low-scoring game so far and it's definitely not out of reach. But our approach needs to change. And we need some luck.

I think we can do this but I'm getting a bit worried. Please pull this out Cavs. We need a HUGE 3rd quarter. We can do it. I believe.
