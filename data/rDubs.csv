He couldn't even have done anything to prevent that though.

"Its not the loss that sucks, its the way people are going to talk about the Warriors and Curry that sucks. You realize that every sports website and tv show is gonna start shitting on the Warriors and Curry in 3/4 hours right? Questions about if Curry should have been a unanimous MVP? Questions about if the Warriors regular season record matters since they didn't get a ring? Its gonna be brutual until next season. GSW have so many haters and they will be gleefully feasting on GSW tears until next season. I can't stand the Lebron fanboys.Idk its going to be a rough offseason. I'm disappointed at the poor decision making of our Coaching staff and players. They threw up shot after shot without driving to the lane and attempting many 2 pointers. We rely way too much on our 3 ball!

"Kerr is gonna have to take a long hard look in the mirror to figure out where we go from here. As a team there are so many questions. What is up with Curry? Is Barnes leaving? Is Ezeli leaving? What is the status of Bogut? Will Iggy be back next year with his back issues? Honestly, I don't think we will see the same Warriors team next season. Especially not after this loss. What we had this season was magically and its hard to recreate that magic. I don't know, I just hope this isn't the last time we make it to finals for a while.

"&gt;  The history of the league has a black mark now, your winningest team didn't get the ring.

Smh what? 

How does Golden State being a better regular season team than a playoff team leave a black mark on the HISTORY of the league?",,,,Kodyak77,,,1466444829,t5_2rtiv,t3_4ovyod,t1_d4g59kx,0,1469172231,0,0,d4gw1fn,warriors,0,,
"Here’s my technical analysis:

In this game, the Cavaliers won because they attempted and scored twice as many free throws as the Warriors (+11 point, Cavs) did. Next, the Cavs and Warriors essentially had the same amount of FGs made and FG attempts, where free throws aren’t counted. This means both had an equal opportunity to score, but the Cavs scored one more field goal than the Warriors (+13, Cavs). However, the Warriors made 9 more 3-pointers than the Cavs, which was the reason why they were winning earlier in the game (+4, Cavs, which is how much they won by). Lebron’s ability to draw fouls on shots/layups (8 made/10 free throw attempts) pushed the Cavaliers over the Warriors in this game.

Here’s my opinion:

Warriors- If you watched their games during the regular season, the amount of passes per possession were much higher than what we saw in this Finals series. We saw flashes of it but not as often as the regular season. Cleveland played a very disciplined man-to-man defense, not allowing the Warriors to get easy passes. In addition, it came down to poor shot selection by the Splash Brothers. As a Warriors fan, it was hard watching the game.

Cavs- In addition to Lebron’s transcendent performance, the unsung hero is Tristan Thompson. The ability to draw rebounding fouls in addition to creating multiple 2nd chance opportunities on offensive boards.
